Our application is a facebook messenger bot, which helps stock traders with current information about stock prices. Our bot is unique in that it can extract when a particular company is in the news and detect sentiment of the news article. It can also display tweets about that particular company. 

## Inspiration
Many stock companies can display statistics and perform predictions based on raw stock data but few of them can detect the public sentiment about the company. Our bot tries to fill that gap, giving the choice to the stock trader whether to trade by predictions from raw data or go with public sentiment.

## What it does
Our bot can display current stock information of any company, obtain news and tweets about it and detect public sentiment.
